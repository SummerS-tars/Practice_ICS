# Lab 8

## Goal

1. use binutils to observe the ELF file  
    analyze the structure of the executable file and the dependency relationship  
2. learn how to use DLL and link to specific DDL  
    understand how the DLL is constructed and how to link the app to it  
3. learn how to interposition(插入，介入) for dynamic link function  
    understand how to intercept and replace the function in the DLL  
    to realize performance monitoring and other advanced functions  

## Provided Files

1. executable file  
    demo  
2. DLL  
    libseries.so  

## What to do?

1. binutils observe ELF file  

2. Edit high performance DLL  

3. Realize `Interposition` function and measure the performance  

## What to submit?

1. Monitoring result report  
2. DLL code and doc  
3. Interposition code and doc
