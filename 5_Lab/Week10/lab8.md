# Lab 8

## Goal

1. use binutils to observe the ELF file  
    analyze the structure of the executable file and the dependency relationship  
2. learn how to use `.so` and link to specific `.so`  
    understand how the shared library is constructed and how to link the app to it  
3. learn how to interposition(插入，介入) for dynamic link function  
    understand how to intercept and replace the function in the `.so`  
    to realize performance monitoring and other advanced functions  

## Provided Files

1. executable file  
    demo  
2. shared library  
    libseries.so  

## What to do?

1. binutils observe ELF file  

2. Edit high performance shared library  

3. Realize `Interposition` function and measure the performance  

## What to submit?

1. Monitoring result report  
2. DLL code and doc  
3. Interposition code and doc
